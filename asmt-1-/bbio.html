        <u>A brief history of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking.</u>
      </p>

      <p class="bb">
        Stephen Hawking was regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical
        physicists in history. His work on the origins and structure of the
        universe, from the Big Bang to black holes, revolutionized the field,
        while his best-selling books have appealed to readers who may not have
        Hawking's scientific background. Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at the
        age of 76. Stephen Hawking was seen by many as the world's smartest
        person, though he never revealed his IQ score. According to the news
        site The Atlantic, when a New York Times reporter asked Hawking what his
        IQ was, he replied with "I have no idea, people who boast about their IQ
        are losers." In this brief biography, we look at Hawking's education and
        career — ranging from his discoveries to the popular books he's written
        — and the disease that robbed him of mobility and speech.

          Hawking was a popular writer. His first book, "A Brief History of
          Time" (10th-anniversary edition: Bantam, 1998) was first published in
          1988 and became an international bestseller. In it, Hawking aimed to
          communicate questions about the birth and death of the universe to the
          layperson.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hawking went on to write other nonfiction books aimed at
          non-scientists. These include "A Briefer History of Time," "The
          Universe in a Nutshell," "The Grand Design" and "On the Shoulders of
          Giants."
        </li>
        <li>
          He and his daughter, Lucy Hawking, also created a fictional series of
          books for middle school children on the creation of the universe,
          including "George and the Big Bang" (Simon & Schuster, 2012).
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2014, a movie based on Hawking's life was released. Called "The
          Theory of Everything," the film drew praise from Hawking, who said it
          made him reflect on his own life. "Although I'm severely disabled, I
          have been successful in my scientific work," Hawking wrote on Facebook
          in November 2014. "I travel widely and have been to Antarctica and
          Easter Island, down in a submarine and up on a zero-gravity flight.
          One day, I hope to go into space."

      <p class="cc"><u>Stephen Hawking Quotes</u></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          "Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set
          of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the
          equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual
          approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer
          the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to
          describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? "
        </li>
        <li>
          "All of my life, I have been fascinated by the big questions that face
          us, and have tried to find scientific answers to them. If, like me,
          you have looked at the stars, and tried to make sense of what you see,
          you too have started to wonder what makes the universe exist."
        </li>
        <li>
          "Science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be
          spontaneously created out of nothing. It is a matter of chance which
          we are in."
        </li>
        <li>
          "The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that
          events do not happen in an arbitrary manner, but that they reflect a
          certain underlying order, which may or may not be divinely inspired. "
        </li>
        <li>
          "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion
          of knowledge."
